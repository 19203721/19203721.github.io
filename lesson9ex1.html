          <p class="lead" style="">The Hong Kong Story permanent exhibition is a showcase of the dedicated hard work done by the Museum staff in the past years in collecting, preserving and researching the history and development of Hong Kong. Occupying an area of 7,000 m2, The Hong Kong Story comprises 8 galleries located on two floors. Through the display of over 4,000 exhibits with the use of 750 graphic panels, a number of dioramas and multi-media programmes, and enhanced with special audio-visual and lighting effects, The Hong Kong Story outlines the natural environment, folk culture and historical development of Hong Kong vividly. The exhibition, which is both entertaining and educational, starts telling the story from the Devonian period 400 million years ago and concludes with the reunification of Hong Kong with China in 1997. We sincerely invite you to this 400 million years of historical and cultural journey, and hope that it can arouse your interest in and introspection on the historical and cultural heritage of Hong Kong. You may visit The Hong Kong Story in about 2 hours. However, if you would like to enjoy the 53 multimedia programmes featured in The Hong Kong Story, including theatre shows and interactive booths, you are advised to spare 3 to 4 hours.</p>
